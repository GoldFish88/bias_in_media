# Bias In Media

Inspired by the amazing work of using tools from computer science to serve news better such as the [improvethenews.org](https://www.improvethenews.org/)

This will be a collection of all my efforts in researching and developing machine learning tools that can be used to analyze bias in media outlets. However, it is also my understanding that _bias_ is an issue that goes far beyond AI, so I will also aim to include studies from the social sciences or emperical surveys that can help shape my knowledge on how to properly analyze bias. My aim is not to create an _objective_ method for analyzing bias (because I believe there can be no such thing), but rather to use scientific methods in order to gain a better understanding of bias that exist in media today.
